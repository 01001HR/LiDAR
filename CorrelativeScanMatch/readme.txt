Correlative scan matching(CSM)[1] is a nearly global map/scan matching algorithm for 2D data. The basic theory 
lies in two layer branch and bound. It should be noted that the original CSM is implemented in C++, GPU boosted OpenGL. 
And this MATLAB code is just for investigating the theory in CSM.
