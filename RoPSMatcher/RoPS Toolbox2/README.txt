* Description:
(1) demo_RoPS_Extraction_Mesh: This function extracts RoPS local features on a mesh (converted from an input point-cloud)
(2) demo_RoPS_Extraction_Pointcloud: This function extracts RoPS local features on an input point-cloud
(3) demo_RoPS_FeatureMatching_Mesh: This function performs feature matching on two input meshes to obtain feature correspondences

* Requirements:
(1) The files "check_face_vertex.m" and "compute_edges.m" are required. They are included in the toolbox_graph
